There recently was news that Coca-Cola was shutting down Odwalla.
This was sad news to most WWDC scholars because Odwalla is one of the primary drinks at WWDC. It's a part of WWDC culture.
So Coca-Cola, I know this might be a unpopular drink that you don't really care about, but when you take away Odwalla you take away a core part of a community. Please make sure you know what you are doing.
