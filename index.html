	<div class="desc">There recently was news that Coca-Cola was shutting down Odwalla.
	This was sad news to most people that drink Odwalla.
	So Coca-Cola, I know this might be an unpopular drink that you don&#39;t really care about, but when you take away Odwalla you take away a core part of a community. Please make sure you know what you are doing.</div>
